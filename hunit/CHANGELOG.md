Changes
=======

Version 0.10.1
---------------

* Provide an explicit implementation of `displayException`
  in `instance Exception HUnitFailure`
  ([#330](https://github.com/UnkindPartition/tasty/issues/330)).

Version 0.10.0.3
----------------

The only point of this release is to introduce compatibility with GHCs back to 7.0
(see https://github.com/UnkindPartition/tasty/pull/287).

Note, however, that these changes are not merged to the master branch, and the
future releases will only support the GHC/base versions from the last 5 years,
as per our usual policy. To test with even older GHCs, you'll have to use this
particular version of tasty-hunit (or have the constraint solver pick it for you
when testing with older GHCs).

The source of this release is in the `support-old-ghcs` branch of the tasty
repository.

Version 0.10.0.2
----------------

Catch all exceptions and time each step in testCaseSteps

Version 0.10.0.1
----------------

Un-deprecate `(@?)` and `AssertionPredicable` and improve their docs

Version 0.10
------------

* Make `assertFailure`'s return type polymorphic
* When a test fails, print the source location of the failing assertion
* Deprecate `Assertable`, `AssertionPredicate`, `AssertionPredicable`, `(@?)`

Version 0.9.2
-------------

Add `testCaseInfo` for tests that return some information upon success

Version 0.9.1
-------------

Add `testCaseSteps` for multi-step tests

Version 0.9.0.1
---------------

Split the changelog out of the main tasty changelog

Version 0.9
-----------

tasty-hunit now does not depend on the original HUnit package. The functions
that were previously re-exported from HUnit have been simply copied to
tasty-hunit.

This is motivated by:

* efficiency (one less package to compile/install)
* reliability (if something happens with HUnit, we won't be affected)

The two packages are still compatible, except for the name clashes and
distinct exception types being thrown on assertion failures.

Version 0.8.0.1
---------------

Fix unbuildable haddock

Version 0.8
-----------

* Exceptions are now handled by tasty rather than by HUnit
* Update to tasty-0.8

Version 0.4.1
-------------

Do not re-export HUnit's `Testable` class

Version 0.2
-----------

Re-export useful bits of `Test.HUnit` from `Test.Tasty.HUnit`
