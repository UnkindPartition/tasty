{- Note [Skipped tests]
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   There are two potential ways to represent the tests that are skipped
   because of their failed dependencies:
   1. With Outcome = Failure, and FailureReason giving the specifics (TestDepFailed)
   2. With a dedicated Outcome = Skipped

   It seems to me that (1) will lead to fewer bugs (esp. in the extension packages),
   because most of the time skipped tests should be handled in the same way
   as failed tests.
   But sometimes it is not obvious what the right behavior should be. E.g.
   should --hide-successes show or hide the skipped tests?

   Perhaps we should hide them, because they aren't really informative.
   Or perhaps we shouldn't hide them, because we are not sure that they
   will pass, and hiding them will imply a false sense of security
   ("there's at most 2 tests failing", whereas in fact there could be much more).

   So I might change this in the future, but for now treating them as
   failures seems the easiest yet reasonable approach.

-- in the README).
--
-- Moreover, if the 'DependencyType' argument is set to 'AllSucceed' and
-- at least one dependency has failed, this test tree will not run at all.
--
-- Tasty does not check that the pattern matches any tests (let alone the
-- correct set of tests), so it is on you to supply the right pattern.
--
-- ==== __Examples__
--
-- The following test will be executed only after all tests that contain
-- @Foo@ anywhere in their path finish.
--
-- @
-- 'after' 'AllFinish' \"Foo\" $
--    @testCase@ \"A test that depends on Foo.Bar\" $ ...
-- @
--
-- Note, however, that our test also happens to contain @Foo@ as part of its name,
-- so it also matches the pattern and becomes a dependency of itself. This
-- will result in a 'Test.Tasty.DependencyLoop' exception. To avoid this, either
-- change the test name so that it doesn't mention @Foo@ or make the
-- pattern more specific.
--
-- You can use AWK patterns, for instance, to specify the full path to the dependency.

-- 'after' 'AllFinish' \"$0 == \\\"Tests.Foo.Bar\\\"\" $
