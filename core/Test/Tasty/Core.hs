-- There is no generic way to create a test case. Instead, every test
-- provider (tasty-hunit, tasty-smallcheck etc.) provides a function to
-- turn a test case into a 'TestTree'.
--
-- Groups can be created using 'testGroup'.

    -- tests.

-- | 'trivialFold' can serve as the basis for custom folds. Just override
-- the fields you need.
--
-- Here's what it does:
--
-- * single tests are mapped to `mempty` (you probably do want to override that)
--
-- * test groups are returned unmodified
--
-- * for a resource, an IO action that throws an exception is passed (you
-- want to override this for runners/ingredients that execute tests)

-- | Fold a test tree into a single value.
--
-- The fold result type should be a monoid. This is used to fold multiple
-- results in a test group. In particular, empty groups get folded into 'mempty'.
--
-- Apart from pure convenience, this function also does the following
-- useful things:
--
-- 1. Keeping track of the current options (which may change due to
-- `PlusTestOptions` nodes)
--
-- 2. Filtering out the tests which do not match the patterns
--
-- Thus, it is preferred to an explicit recursive traversal of the tree.
--
-- Note: right now, the patterns are looked up only once, and won't be
-- affected by the subsequent option changes. This shouldn't be a problem
-- in practice; OTOH, this behaviour may be changed later.
