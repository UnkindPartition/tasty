# Tasty

**Tasty** is a modern testing framework for Haskell.

It lets you combine your unit tests, golden tests, QuickCheck/SmallCheck
properties, and any other types of tests into a single test suite.

Features:

* Run tests in parallel but report results in a deterministic order
* Filter the tests to be run using patterns specified on the command line
* Hierarchical, colored display of test results
* Reporting of test statistics
* Acquire and release resources (sockets, temporary files etc.) that can be
  shared among several tests
* Extensibility: add your own test providers and ingredients (runners) above and
  beyond those provided

## Example

Here's how your `test.hs` might look like:

```haskell
import Test.Tasty
import Test.Tasty.SmallCheck as SC
import Test.Tasty.QuickCheck as QC
import Test.Tasty.HUnit

import Data.List
import Data.Ord

main = defaultMain tests

tests :: TestTree
tests = testGroup "Tests" [properties, unitTests]

properties :: TestTree
properties = testGroup "Properties" [scProps, qcProps]

scProps = testGroup "(checked by SmallCheck)"
  [ SC.testProperty "sort == sort . reverse" $
      \list -> sort (list :: [Int]) == sort (reverse list)
  , SC.testProperty "Fermat's little theorem" $
      \x -> ((x :: Integer)^7 - x) `mod` 7 == 0
  -- the following property does not hold
  , SC.testProperty "Fermat's last theorem" $
      \x y z n ->
        (n :: Integer) >= 3 SC.==> x^n + y^n /= (z^n :: Integer)
  ]

qcProps = testGroup "(checked by QuickCheck)"
  [ QC.testProperty "sort == sort . reverse" $
      \list -> sort (list :: [Int]) == sort (reverse list)
  , QC.testProperty "Fermat's little theorem" $
      \x -> ((x :: Integer)^7 - x) `mod` 7 == 0
  -- the following property does not hold
  , QC.testProperty "Fermat's last theorem" $
      \x y z n ->
        (n :: Integer) >= 3 QC.==> x^n + y^n /= (z^n :: Integer)
  ]

unitTests = testGroup "Unit tests"
  [ testCase "List comparison (different length)" $
      [1, 2, 3] `compare` [1,2] @?= GT

  -- the following test does not hold
  , testCase "List comparison (same length)" $
      [1, 2, 3] `compare` [1,2,2] @?= LT
  ]
```

And here is the output of the above program:

(Note that whether QuickCheck finds a counterexample to the third property is
determined by chance.)

## Packages

[tasty][] is the core package. It contains basic definitions and APIs and a
console runner.

[tasty]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty

In order to create a test suite, you also need to install one or more «providers» (see
below).

### Providers

The following providers exist:

* [tasty-hunit](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-hunit) — for unit tests
  (based on [HUnit](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HUnit))
* [tasty-golden][] — for golden
  tests, which are unit tests whose results are kept in files
* [tasty-smallcheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-smallcheck) —
  exhaustive property-based testing
  (based on [smallcheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/smallcheck))
* [tasty-quickcheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-quickcheck) — for randomized
  property-based testing (based on [QuickCheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck))
* [tasty-hspec](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-hspec) — for
  [Hspec](http://hspec.github.io/) tests
* [tasty-program](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-program) — run
  external program and test whether it terminates successfully

[tasty-golden]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-golden

It's easy to create custom providers using the API from `Test.Tasty.Providers`.

### Ingredients

Ingredients represent different actions that you can perform on your test suite.
One obvious ingredient that you want to include is one that runs tests and
reports the progress and results.

Another standard ingredient is one that simply prints the names of all tests.

It is possible to write custom ingredients using the API from `Test.Tasty.Runners`.

Some ingredients that can enhance your test suite are:

* [tasty-ant-xml](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-ant-xml) adds a
  possibility to write the test results in a machine-readable XML format, which
  is understood by various CI systems and IDEs
* If you use [tasty-golden][] to write unit tests, there's an ingredient in
  `Test.Tasty.Golden.Manage` that helps you manage your golden files
* [tasty-rerun](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-rerun) adds support for
  minimal test reruns by recording previous test runs and using this information
  to filter the test tree. For example, you can use this ingredient to only run
  failed tests, or only run tests that threw an exception.

### Other packages

* [tasty-th](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-th) automatically
discovers tests based on the function names and generate the boilerplate code for
you
* [tasty-hunit-adapter](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-hunit-adapter)
  converts existing HUnit test suites into tasty test suites

## Options

Options allow one to customize the run-time behavior of the test suite, such
as:

* mode of operation (run tests, list tests, run tests quietly etc.)
* which tests are run (see «Patterns» below)
* parameters of individual providers (like depth of search for SmallCheck)

### Setting options

There are two main ways to set options:

#### Runtime

When using the standard console runner, the options can be passed on the
command line or via environment variables. To see the available options, run
your test suite with the `--help` flag. The output will look something like this
(depending on which ingredients and providers the test suite uses):

```
% ./test --help
Mmm... tasty test suite

Usage: ex [-p|--pattern ARG] [-l|--list-tests] [-j|--num-threads ARG]
          [-q|--quiet] [--hide-successes] [--smallcheck-depth ARG]
          [--quickcheck-tests ARG] [--quickcheck-replay ARG]
          [--quickcheck-max-size ARG] [--quickcheck-max-ratio ARG]

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  -p,--pattern ARG         Select only tests that match pattern
  -l,--list-tests          Do not run the tests; just print their names
  -j,--num-threads ARG     Number of threads to use for tests execution
  -q,--quiet               Do not produce any output; indicate success only by
                           the exit code
  --hide-successes         Do not print tests that passed successfully
  --smallcheck-depth ARG   Depth to use for smallcheck tests
  --quickcheck-tests ARG   Number of test cases for QuickCheck to generate
  --quickcheck-replay ARG  Replay token to use for replaying a previous test run
  --quickcheck-max-size ARG
                           Size of the biggest test cases quickcheck generates
  --quickcheck-max-ratio ARG
                           Maximum number of discared tests per successful test
                           before giving up
```

Every option can be passed via environment. To obtain the environment variable
name from the option name, replace hyphens `-` with underscores `_`, capitalize
all letters, and prepend `TASTY_`. For example, the environment equivalent of
`--smallcheck-depth` is `TASTY_SMALLCHECK_DEPTH`. To turn on a switch (such as
`TASTY_HIDE_SUCCESSES`), set the variable to `True`.

If you're using a non-console runner, please refer to its documentation to find
out how to configure options during the run time.

#### Compile-time

You can also specify options in the test suite itself, using
`localOption`. It can be applied not only to the whole test tree, but also to
individual tests or subgroups, so that different tests can be run with
different options.

It is possible to combine run-time and compile-time options, too, by using
`adjustOption`. For example, make the overall testing depth configurable
during the run time, but increase or decrease it slightly for individual
tests.

This method currently doesn't work for ingredient options, such as `--quiet` or
`--num-threads`.

### Patterns

It is possible to restrict the set of executed tests using the `--pattern`
option. The syntax of patterns is the same as for test-framework, namely:

-   An optional prefixed bang `!` negates the pattern.
-   If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of
    the following description, but it would only find a match with a
    test group. In other words, `foo/` will match a group called `foo`
    and any tests underneath it, but will not match a regular test
    `foo`.
-   If the pattern does not contain a slash `/`, the framework checks
    for a match against any single component of the path.
-   Otherwise, the pattern is treated as a glob, where:
    -   The wildcard `*` matches anything within a single path component
        (i.e. `foo` but not `foo/bar`).
    -   Two wildcards `**` matches anything (i.e. `foo` and `foo/bar`).
    -   Anything else matches exactly that text in the path (i.e. `foo`
        would only match a component of the test path called `foo` (or a
        substring of that form).

For example, `group/*1` matches `group/test1` but not
`group/subgroup/test1`, whereas both examples would be matched by
`group/**1`. A leading slash matches the beginning of the test path; for
example, `/test*` matches `test1` but not `group/test1`.

### Running tests in parallel

In order to run tests in parallel, you have to do the following:

* Compile (or, more precisely, *link*) your test program with the `-threaded`
  flag;
* Launch the program with `+RTS -N -RTS`.

### Timeout

To apply timeout to individual tests, use the `--timeout` (or `-t`) command-line
option, or set the option in your test suite using the `mkTimeout` function.

Timeouts can be fractional, and can be optionally followed by a suffix `ms`
(milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), or `h` (hours). When there's no
suffix, seconds are assumed.

Example:

    ./test --timeout=0.5m

sets a 30 seconds timeout for each individual test.

The `--soft-timeout` applies a timeout, but gives the test runner the option to
intercept the timeout. Best used in conjunction with a slightly larger
`--timeout` value.

### Options controlling console output

The following options control behavior of the standard console interface:

<dl>
<dt><code>-q,--quiet</code></dt>
<dd>
  Run the tests but don't output anything. The result is indicated only by the
  exit code, which is 1 if at least one test has failed, and 0 if all tests
  have passed. Execution stops when the first failure is detected, so not all
  tests are necessarily run.
  This may be useful for various batch systems, such as commit hooks.
</dd>
<dt><code>--hide-successes</code></dt>
<dd>Report only the tests that has failed. Especially useful when the
number of tests is large.</dd>
<dt><code>-l,--list-tests</code></dt>
<dd>Don't run the tests; only list their names, in the format accepted by
<code>--pattern</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>--color</code></dt>
<dd>Whether to produce colorful output. Accepted values: <code>never</code>,
<code>always</code>, <code>auto</code>. <code>auto</code> means that colors will
only be enabled when output goes to a terminal and is the default value.</dd>
</dl>

### Custom options

It is possible to add custom options, too.

To do that,

1. Define a datatype to represent the option, and make it an instance of
   `IsOption`
2. Register the options with the `includingOptions` ingredient
3. To query the option value, use `askOption`.

See the [Custom options in Tasty][custom-options-article] article for some examples.

## Project organization and integration with Cabal

There may be several ways to organize your project. What follows is not
Tasty's requirements but my recommendations.

### Tests for a library

Place your test suite sources in a dedicated subdirectory (called `tests`
here) instead of putting them among the main library sources.

The directory structure will be as follows:

    my-project/
      my-project.cabal
      src/
        ...
      tests/
        test.hs
        Mod1.hs
        Mod2.hs
        ...

`test.hs` is where your `main` function is defined. The tests may be
contained in `test.hs` or spread across multiple modules (`Mod1.hs`, `Mod2.hs`,
...) which are then imported by `test.hs`.

Add the following section to the cabal file (`my-project.cabal`):

    test-suite test
      default-language:
        Haskell2010
      type:
        exitcode-stdio-1.0
      hs-source-dirs:
        tests
      main-is:
        test.hs
      build-depends:
          base >= 4 && < 5
        , tasty >= 0.7 -- insert the current version here
        , my-project   -- depend on the library we're testing
        , ...

### Tests for a program

All the above applies, except you can't depend on the library if there's no
library. You have two options:

* Re-organize the project into a library and a program, so that both the
  program and the test suite depend on this new library. The library can be
  declared in the same cabal file.
* Add your program sources directory to the `Hs-source-dirs`. Note that this
  will lead to double compilation (once for the program and once for the test
  suite).

## Background

Tasty is heavily influenced by [test-framework][].

The problems with test-framework are:

* Poor code style (some lines of the code wouldn't even fit in a twitter message!)
* Poor architecture — e.g. relying on laziness for IO and control flow. The
  whole story with `:~>` and `ImprovingIO` is really obscure.
* Non-extensible options. For example, when I integrated SmallCheck with
  test-framework (in the form of the `test-framework-smallcheck` package), I
  still had to submit patches to the main package to make SmallCheck depth
  customizable by the user.
* The project is effectively unmaintained.

So I decided to recreate everything that I liked in test-framework from scratch
in this package.
